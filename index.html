      description: Publishing election results is a full stack process. On the back end, I write software to download, parse, and transform raw results from the Associated Press and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/datadesk/la-election-night">County of Los Angeles</a>. On the front end, I build maps and charts to visualize the results in real time. I also build live-updating widgets for the homescreen of latimes.com.
